   - DoD: no bare "tbd" in Ch6; all new prose \changed; compile clean
## M8 Global QA & delivery [ ] not started

## Open questions for Antoni
- **14 vs 15 generators** (pre-seeded §11.1): §2 "Mario Level Generators in the Literature" says
  "includes 15 generators"; `tab:generators` has 14 rows; EDA reports 14 generator IDs;
  `tab:eval-comparison` bottom row also says "15 generators (all paradigms)". Normalised in M6
  with a `\TODO`; the eval-comparison table cell left untouched but flagged here.
- **Exact snapshot dates** (§11.2): training-snapshot extraction, deployment, and
  post-deployment snapshot dates within January 2026 unknown; `\TODO` placeholders inserted (M2/M5).
- **Title-page `\date{March 2026}`** (§11.3): likely stale (analysis extends to May 2026). Flagged, not changed.
- **Chapter 4 title** (§11.4): set to "User Study: Measuring and Modelling Player Preference" per brief; author may prefer a variant.
- **Polish abstract clause** (§11.5): PL judge sentence drafted by agent in M1; needs author's PL review (existing `\KOT{todo -- przeczytać PL potem}` already requests this).
- **M2 DoD interpretation**: brief M2 requires the Ch4 roadmap to state "the chapter answers RQ1 / RQ2",
  which necessarily leaves (new-scheme) `RQ` tokens in Ch4; the "grep RQ[0-9] returns nothing" DoD is
  read as "no *stale* (old five-RQ scheme) references". All remaining RQ hits audited in M8.
