Summary. Paired comparison data in which the abilities or merits of the objects being compared
may be changing over time can be modelled as a non-linear state space model. When the popu-
lation of objects being compared is large, likelihood-based analyses can be too computationally
cumbersome to carry out regularly. This presents a problem for rating populations of chess players
and other large groups which often consist of tens of thousands of competitors. This problem is
overcome through a computationally simple non-iterative algorithm for ®tting a particular dynamic
paired comparison model. The algorithm, which improves over the commonly used algorithm of Elo
by incorporating the variability in parameter estimates, can be performed regularly even for large
populations of competitors. The method is evaluated on simulated data and is applied to ranking the
best chess players of all time, and to ranking the top current tennis-players.

Introduction
Paired comparison models address data that arise from situations in which two objects or
treatments are compared at the same time to determine a degree of preference. Examples
include modelling choice behaviour (preference of one soft drink to another or the preference
of the Democratic presidential candidate to the Republican candidate), competitive ability in
sports (determining the strengths of teams in basketball or baseball) and many others. A
review of some examples and issues involved in paired comparison modelling was given by
David (1988) and Bradley (1984).
Recent work (Fahrmeir and Tutz, 1994; Glickman, 1993) extended the usual (static) paired
comparison models by including parameters that are time varying. These `dynamic' paired
comparison models are appropriate, for example, for modelling paired comparison data
arising from competitive sports where player or team abilities change over time. When the
size of the population of competitors is reasonably small, the methodologies developed in
these papers present no computational diculties. However, these methods are inadequate
for large populations of competitors because the computation becomes intractable. For
example, with more than 30000 chess players playing over 450000 games each year in United
States Chess Federation (USCF) chess tournaments, other less computationally intensive
methods for ®tting dynamic paired comparison models need to be considered.
This paper presents a non-iterative method for ®tting dynamic paired comparison models.
The method is especially useful when the population of objects or treatments to be compared

is large, and where parameter estimates are desired on an on-going basis. Measuring the
abilities of chess players is the motivating example, though the method applies directly to
other paired comparison settings where abilities or merits change over time. Section 2
introduces our dynamic paired comparison model. The non-iterative parameter updating
algorithm is presented in Section 3. In our procedure, certain parameters need to be estimated
before applying the updating algorithm, and the estimation of these model parameters is
described in Section 4. The algorithm is then evaluated on simulated data in Section 5.
Finally, the method is applied to two data sets: outcomes of chess games between the best
chess players of all time and outcomes of tennis matches played between current tournament
players.
2.
A dynamic paired comparison model
The model that we assume for competitor ability is closely related to the Bradley±Terry
model for paired comparisons (Bradley and Terry, 1952). The Bradley±Terry model asserts
that, for two objects with merit parameters 1 and 2, object 1 is preferred to object 2 with
probability 1=1  2. For our speci®c problem, let i and j be the unknown (scalar)
strengths for players i and j at a ®xed point in time. Assume ®rst that a game results in only
two outcomes: a win or a loss. Let sijk be the kth outcome of a game played between players i
and j, where sijk  1 when player i wins and sijk  0 when player j wins. The model for game
outcomes, not allowing for ties or partial preferences, is given by
Prsijk  s  10iÿj=400s
1  10iÿj=400 ,
1
for s  0, 1. This is simply a reparameterized version of the Bradley±Terry model. Like-
lihood-based inference for the Bradley±Terry model is straightforward from a set of
paired comparison data. This particular reparameterization was chosen to produce param-
eter estimates that have an interpretation on the same scale as the USCF rating system, which
corresponds to strength estimates roughly between 0 and 3000.
Several extensions to the Bradley±Terry model incorporating ties have been proposed,
including those by Davidson (1970) and Rao and Kupper (1967), each of whom introduced a
single parameter governing the frequency of ties. Joe (1990) found that Davidson's model is
not well ®tted by a particular chess data set. In our likelihood framework, instead of adopting
an approach that models a tie as a possible outcome of a game, we act as if ties do not really
occur, but we treat a tie as half way between a win and a loss when constructing the likelihood.
This approach avoids the complications of including extra (possibly time-varying) param-
eters in the model to account for the probability of a third outcome. More formally, we
assume that the information about players' strengths resulting from a win followed by a loss
is equivalent to the information resulting from two consecutive ties. Thus, if p is the
probability that the ®rst player wins, so that the contribution to the likelihood of a win
followed by a loss is p1 ÿ p, then the contribution to the likelihood of a single tie should be
pfp1 ÿ pg. We therefore construct a likelihood using terms in model (1) where a tie
corresponds to s  0:5. Other extensions to the Bradley±Terry model, such as recognizing a
home ground advantage for certain sports or the advantage of having the ®rst move in chess,
can be incorporated by the inclusion of an `order eect' parameter, as in Davidson and
Beaver (1977). We do not pursue this extension here.
Model (1) addresses measuring competitor ability when players' abilities remain ®xed over

time. This model can be extended to recognize that players' abilities can change over time.
Glickman (1993) and Fahrmeir and Tutz (1994) explored an approach to modelling paired
comparison data with time-varying abilities through the use of state space models. To use this
approach, we assume that groups of comparisons considered to be collected in a short time
interval are assumed to fall in the same `rating period'. For example, chess tournament games
played during a 2-month period could be considered to be part of the same rating period.
Denoting the strength of player i during a rating period at time t0 by 
t0
i
, and the strength of
player i a rating period t units of time later by 
t0t
i
, we adopt a model that assumes

i
j
t0
i
, 2, t  N
t0
i
, 2t,
2
where 2 is the increase in variance in competitors' strength per unit time. This model asserts
that, as time passes while a player is not competing, the description of a competitor's strength
becomes more uncertain. Knowledge of a player's activities (e.g. preparation) between events
could be incorporated in model (2), but we assume that such information is not generally
available.
A likelihood-based analysis of paired comparison data using state space models can follow
either Fahrmeir and Tutz (1994), who used empirical Bayes methods, or Glickman (1993),
who used Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation from the posterior distribution. In both
approaches, a complete analysis involves estimating all the parameters jointly. With a small
population of competitors (e.g. teams in a league), this does not present a diculty. However,
because competitions in many organizations involve populations of thousands of players (e.g.
chess or interactive games on the Internet), an exact likelihood-based analysis may not be
computationally feasible.

An approximate Bayesian updating algorithm
Suppressing the superscript t, let  be the strength parameter of a player whose ability is to be
estimated. Before a rating period, we assume that the prior distribution of a player's strength
is
j, 2  N, 2
3
with  and 2 known. During a rating period, the player competes against m opponents,
playing nj games against opponent j, where j  1, . . ., m. We assume that the distribution of
the jth opponent's strength, j, is
jjj, 2
j  Nj, 2
j 
4
with known j and 2
j . Let sjk be the score of the kth game against opponent j, with sjk  1 if
the player wins game k, sjk  0:5 if the game results in a tie and sjk  0 if the player loses. As
before, we assume that the likelihood will be a product of Bradley±Terry `probabilities'

The following sections develop a rating system based on closed form approximations to the
computations required to perform a fully Bayesian model ®t of the state space model
described in Section 2. The rating algorithm is implemented as follows.
(a) Collect game outcome data over a rating period.

## Page 4

(b) At the end of the period, update players' rating distributions due to game outcomes
from their preperiod (prior) rating distributions.
(c) Subsequently update players' rating distributions due to the passage of time.
This is repeated for every rating period.
We proceed by describing prior distributions for players who had not previously competed
in tournaments, then the procedure for computing posterior distributions of strengths due to
the passage of time and ®nally the procedure for updating the strength distributions due to
game results. The updating algorithm from game results is assessed in a simulation analysis.
We also describe a smoothing procedure to make inferences on player strengths for early
rating periods.
3.1.
Prior distribution of strengths
Assume that, before competing, players' strengths are drawn independently from a normal
distribution with mean 1500 and unknown variance. The initial variance 2
0 is treated as a
parameter to be inferred from data. Thus, the prior distribution assumed for any player with
strength parameter  before competing is
j2
0  N1500, 2
0,
2
0 / 1:
Incorporating useful sources of information (such as players' ages) could result in more
informative prior distributions, though for the development of the algorithm such information
is assumed to be unavailable.
3.2.
Updating from the passage of time
In performing the updating computations, we act as if all games in a rating period are played
at the beginning of the period. Over the duration of the rating period, we assume that
knowledge of a player's strength becomes less certain, so that the parameter variance
increases. At time t0, assume that a player's strength is distributed as
t0j, 2  N, 2:
6
Integrating the distribution of t0tjt0, 2, t  Nt0, 2t with respect to the prior distri-
bution (6) yields
t0tj, 2, 2, t  N, 2  2t,
7
where 2 is the increase in variance per unit time. In other words, an elapse of t units in time
corresponds to an increase in 2t in the variance. This model for the increase in variance
preserves the additivity of variance with respect to time. The variance per unit time, 2, is a
parameter that needs to be inferred in the model ®tting process.
The choice of the length of a rating period involves a variance±bias trade-o. For short
rating periods, few data may be available to estimate players' strengths, and the analytic
approximations used in the algorithm in Section 3.3 may not be dependable. Conversely, if
long rating periods are used, a player's ability may have changed substantially over a rating
period, but this would not be detectable. The best compromise seems to be rating periods that
are as short as possible, but where enough data are available to have some indication of
players' strengths, perhaps at least 5±10 games per player on average.

Updating from outcomes of games
At the beginning of a rating period, every competitor has a normal prior distribution of their
playing strength. Rather than determine the posterior distribution of all strength parameters
simultaneously making use of all paired comparison information, we carry out an approx-
imate Bayesian analysis which leads to a tractable set of closed form computations. The key
idea is that the marginal posterior distribution of a player's strength is determined by
integrating out the opponents' strength parameters over their prior distribution rather than
over their posterior distribution. The main disadvantage of this approach is that potentially
important information is sacri®ced, particularly the outcomes of opponents' games against
other opponents. This is done to derive a set of closed form computations. Thus inferences
from our algorithm will not be as precise as a fully Bayesian analysis. This sacri®ce of
precision appears necessary if posterior updates are needed on an on-going basis.
Letting s be the collection of outcomes of games during a rating period, the marginal
posterior distribution of  can be approximated as the integral of the posterior distribution of
 conditional on opponents' strengths integrated over their prior distribution,

This expression may be evaluated by using numerical methods, such as Monte Carlo

These calculations are carried out in parallel for each player individually over the rating
period to produce the approximating normal posterior distributions of each player's strength.
The posterior mean updating approximation in equation (9) has close connections to the
chess rating system of Elo (1978). Elo's system was adopted by the USCF in the early 1960s
and subsequently by the World Chess Federation in 1970. Most national chess organizations,
as well as national organizations for tournament table-tennis and Scrabble, have adopted
Elo's system with minor variations. If a player has an estimated strength ~ at the onset of a
rating period, then the Elo algorithm for updating a player's strength estimate from the
outcomes of games is given by

is the approximate probability of defeating player j as a function of the estimates of strength.
The Elo updating algorithm is seen to be a special case of equation (9). If 2

opponents, implying that all opponents' mean strengths are known without error, then
g2

updating formula with

13
The computations in equations (9) and (10) may be preferable because they make use of the
expected game outcome incorporating the uncertainty in the player's own strength and in the
opponents' strengths, and the variability due to the game outcomes (represented by 2). The
updating formula (9) distinguishes the uncertainty in opponents' strengths by allowing g. to
be less than 1; when an opponent's prior rating variance 2
j is large, then g2
j  is substantially
less than 1, and therefore the contribution of this opponent to the sum in equation (9) will be
relatively small. Also, the fraction in equation (13) in eect weights the results of games
relative to the precision of one's strength before a competition. Thus, in contrast with the Elo
updating formula, the value of K depends on the prior precision of one's strength. When
one's prior strength is uncertain, the outcomes of games have a potentially substantial eect
on one's strength distribution update, and this is re¯ected in a large value of equation (13).
When one's prior strength is precisely measured, then the outcomes of games should have
little eect on one's strength update, and equation (13) is small.

Accuracy of approximation
The accuracy of the approximation to the marginal posterior distribution (8) by a normal
distribution with parameters given by equations (9) and (10) is assessed through simulation.
We examine the accuracy of the updating algorithm when a player competes against 4, 10, 20
or 50 opponents in a rating period.
For a given number of opponents in a rating period, a player with prior strength distri-
bution   N1500, 1002 competes against opponents with normal prior distributions having
means drawn from N1500, 1002 and standard deviations drawn from a scaled inverse 2-
distribution on 10 degrees of freedom with mean 50. Outcomes of games were determined by
simulating strengths from the prior distributions, and then simulating binary outcomes given
the strengths. From a simulated collection of game outcomes and opponents' prior strength
distributions, the computations in equations (9) and (10) were carried out. Additionally, 500
values of the marginal posterior distribution of  given in expression (8) were simulated via
Monte Carlo integration by using the weighted bootstrap (Smith and Gelfand, 1992). This
was accomplished by generating 10000 random draws of  from the player's prior distri-
bution, determining the corresponding (approximate) marginal likelihoods evaluated at each
of the draws (which involved averaging Bradley±Terry probabilities over 50 random draws
from each opponent's prior distribution) and then drawing 500 values of  without replace-
ment from the original 10000 with probabilities proportional to the marginal likelihoods.
The 500 values were summarized by means and standard deviations, and also by the pro-
portion of values that lay within nominal 50% and 95% normal posterior intervals based
on the approximating mean and standard deviation from equations (9) and (10). This entire
process of calculating posterior summaries by the approximating method and the weighted
bootstrap for each collection of simulated parameters and outcomes of games was repeated
500 times for each ®xed number of opponents.
The results of the analyses are displayed in Table 1. The entries of Table 1 summarize the
results of the 500 simulated data sets per number of opponents. On average, for 4, 10, 20 or
50 opponents in one rating period, approximately 50% and 95% of weighted bootstrap
draws fall within 50% and 95% nominal posterior intervals constructed from the approx-
imating normal distribution using the updating formulae. This suggests that, on average, the
approximating normal distribution produced by the updating algorithm closely approximates
the distribution of values determined from the weighted bootstrap. Because the entries in
Table 1 are slightly less, on average, than the nominal coverage fractions, the updating
algorithm produces mean and variance estimates that slightly overstate the precision of the
marginal posterior distribution. One possible reason is that the updating algorithm produces

posterior standard deviations that do not make full use of the data, resulting in variance
estimates that are too small when a player has extreme results (relative to the prior distri-
bution), and too large when a player's results are very consistent with the prior distribution.
See Appendix A for computational details. This approximation becomes slightly ampli®ed
when more opponents are involved in the computations. It appears, however, that the
approximating algorithm produces estimates that are suciently close to the Monte Carlo
approach for practical purposes.
3.5.
Parameter smoothing
The algorithm developed in Section 3.3 results in approximate posterior distributions of each
player's strength parameter at the end of each rating period conditionally only on preceding
outcomes of games. Thus, the algorithm makes ecient use of the data for estimating players'
current strengths but makes poor use of the data for estimating strengths of players during
early rating periods. A smoothing procedure is now described to obtain approximate posterior
distributions of strength parameters about earlier rating periods conditionally on both
previous and future data. This algorithm is the standard `backward ®ltering' of the Kalman
®lter to obtain smoothed estimates of past parameters.
Let t  1, 2, . . ., T sequentially index each of T equally spaced rating periods. Denote the
collection of all available outcomes of games in all rating periods before and including period
t by st. Carrying out the (forward) rating algorithm, we obtain approximate normal

describes a procedure to estimate these parameters.

de®ne the `predictive discrepancy' for a game between i and j during period t as a measure of
discrepancy between the predicted result for the game, given only information before period

Expression (16) is an approximation to the probability that i defeats j incorporating the
variability of each player's strength estimate and is derived analogously to the expected
outcome integrated over an opponent's prior strength distribution. Thus the predictive dis-
crepancy dij in equation (15) is the binomial log-likelihood for a game evaluated at a value
that only depends on previous data.
The total discrepancy for the entire collection of outcomes of games is computed as the
sum of the dij over all games in the data set. This is accomplished by ®rst summing the dis-
crepancies in the ®rst rating period, then updating the strength distributions based on the
outcomes of games from the ®rst period followed by updating the distributions due to the pass-
age of time, then summing the discrepancies in the second rating period given the updated
strength distributions, and so on. Because the discrepancies in results are cross-validatory,
minimizing the total discrepancy is unlikely to result in an over®tted choice of variance
parameters. Loss functions that involve measuring a discrepancy between predicted and
actual outcomes, where the predicted outcome depends on all the data, may result in
excessively large estimates of 2 in order to allow a player's strengths to have unlimited
variation from one rating period to the next.
Several numerical methods for minimizing the total discrepancy as a function of 2 and 2
are feasible. However, because the total discrepancy is a complicated function of 2 and 2,
methods involving closed form derivatives are not possible. To minimize the total dis-
crepancy, the Nelder±Mead simplex algorithm (Nelder and Mead, 1965) was employed. This
algorithm uses a direct search approach rather than numerically computing gradient
information.
5.
Evaluation of the estimation algorithm
To evaluate the variance estimation procedure, the algorithm was applied to simulated data
under three dierent sets of assumed parameters and conditions:
(a) simulation 1 Ð 10 players competing over 30 rating periods, playing a total of 50 games
per period, with 0  200 and   50,
(b) simulation 2 Ð 10 players competing over 120 rating periods, playing a total of 50
games per period, with 0  200 and   50, and
(c) simulation 3 Ð 20 players competing over 50 rating periods, playing a total of 200
games per period, with 0  200 and   10.
For each of the three simulation conditions, the ®ctitious competitors would compete with
each other at random for the speci®ed number of rating periods, over which their strengths

would change by the addition of N0, 2 at the beginning of each successive rating period.
This procedure was repeated 200 times for each of the three simulation conditions. From the
results of each simulated data set, estimates of 0 and  were obtained by using the approach
in Section 4 and then used to compute ratings from the ®nal rating period.
A summary of the analyses is shown in Table 2. The estimates of 0 and  were calculated
by using the simplex method, and the averages of these estimates over the 200 replications are
shown in the fourth and ®fth columns of Table 2. The estimation procedure seems to produce
estimates that are reasonably close to the underlying parameters. Sampling variability would
explain some of the discrepancy. The slightly large estimates of 0 re¯ects that its posterior
distribution is skewed. This can be seen in Fig. 1, which shows the approximate joint pos-
terior distribution of the two standard deviation parameters. These plots demonstrate that
the posterior distribution of the standard deviation parameters are centred near the generating
parameters. The large posterior variability of 0 re¯ects the small number of players in the
simulations. Not surprisingly, the posterior variability of  is smaller when the number of
rating periods is larger.
The last two columns of Table 2 show how well the estimated strengths from the last rating
period correspond to the true parameter values. For each set of simulations, normal posterior
distributions at the end of the last rating period are obtained for all players by using the
estimated values of 0 and . Also, the true mean strengths during the last rating period were
recorded. After centring the estimated and true mean strengths to 1500 for each of the 200
replications, we determined the proportion of the players across the 200 replications that
have 50% and 95% central posterior intervals containing their true mean strength at the last
rating period. These appear in the last two columns in Table 2. The strengths were centred
because drift in average strength cannot be detected from paired comparison data; if all
players increased in strength by the same amount from one rating period to the next, it would
be impossible to determine this from the data. In all cases, the actual proportion of coverage
is close to the nominal level of coverage. This is particularly true for the third simulation
which had parameters that were more precisely estimated because the size of the simulated
data set per replication was large. For the ®rst two simulations, the actual fraction of
coverage is slightly less than the reported level of coverage, indicating that a player's
approximate normal posterior distribution from the updating algorithm may be overstating
the precision under similar conditions. However, the coverage is still fairly close to nominal,
and with a large set of data coverage does not appear to be a problem.

Examples
We apply the methodology of Section 3 to the analysis of two data sets. The ®rst data set
consists of all known results of games from 1857 to 1991 between 88 of the world's all-time
best chess players. The second data set involves the outcomes of tennis-matches played
between 1190 competitors from 1986 to 1995.

The best chess players of all time
Professor Nathan Divinsky has compiled a data set consisting of all known tournament or
match game results between 88 of the top chess players of all time. The data set contains
15664 outcomes of games played between 1367 pairs of players. Not all
88

 3828 pairs of
players competed against each other because some players' lives, much less their playing
careers, did not overlap. Several analyses based on smaller versions of this data set have been
published, including those by Elo (1978), Keene and Divinsky (1989), Joe (1990) and Henery
(1992). Elo ®tted paired comparison models separately in each year and then smoothed the
estimates. Keene and Divinsky ®tted a Bradley±Terry model to the data, acting as if all the
games were played in one large tournament. Joe divided players' careers into `peak' and `o-
peak' periods, and ®tted an extension of the Bradley±Terry model explicitly accounting for
ties. Henery ®tted a model that accounts for diering frequencies of ties, but not the
possibility of changes in abilities over time.
For our analysis, a single rating period is a year, so the number of rating periods is 135. In
some years no outcomes of games were observed (e.g. 1859, 1874 and 1875), but this is
handled by applying the computations in Section 3.2 in succession. The prior variance for a
player was constrained to be 2 for the year of ®rst competition. The total discrepancy was
minimized for   38:19 and   18:87. Using these values, estimates of all players' strengths
for every year were computed by using the rating algorithm followed by the backward
smoothing procedure.
In Table 3, the top 20 players are ranked according to their peak posterior mean strength,
along with the posterior standard deviation of the strength and the year in which the player
attained highest strength (the peak year). The top eight players on the list are former and
current world champions. The top eight players identi®ed by Joe (1990) match the top eight

in Table 3, except that Steinitz is replaced by Paul Morphy. The data set consists of only 25
games against two opponents played by Morphy between 1857 and 1858, so there is very little
information in our analysis that would indicate such profound playing strength (Morphy is
ranked 27 on our list). The ninth on the list, Akiba Rubinstein, is the highest ranked player
who never held the world championship. Because of the possible increase in overall playing
strength (which could result from an increased understanding of chess over time), the
posterior mean strengths of players at dierent points in time cannot be directly compared.
Instead, one should interpret Table 3 as indicating the level of strength relative to current
competitors. Thus, according to the data analysis, Lasker dominated his opponents around
1916 more so than Fischer did in 1972.
Fig. 2 shows the strengths of the top eight players plotted over time. Typically, at the
beginning of their careers, they are moderate in strength, with a gradual climb towards their
peak strength and then a gradual decline. The most obvious exception is Fischer, who gave
up competitive chess in 1972 after winning the world championship. The plot also suggests
that Kasparov may have still been on the rise in 1991, and that Karpov has been gradually
declining in strength since his peak in the mid-1980s. Both Alekhine and Botvinnik had
careers that ended without a steep decline.

the end of 1995 in events on the ATP tour. The ATP tour is generally regarded as the main
international organizer of men's professional tennis. Games were excluded from the analysis
if they were played in events that did not award ATP `points', e.g. the Davis Cup and some
ATP tour championships. Rating periods were designated to be 2 months long, resulting in
60 rating periods. As in the analysis of outcomes of chess games, the prior variance for a
player was assumed to be 2 during the rating period in which he ®rst competed.
Minimizing the total discrepancy for these data yielded values of   113:65 and  
22:35. In contrast with the chess outcomes analysis, the spread of players' initial strengths
is much larger, indicating a wider variation of playing strengths among the tennis competit-
ors. Because the chess players were selected to be (roughly) the 88 best in the world over
all time, whereas the 1190 tennis-players were likely to be the best only in a 10-year period,
the greater variability in the tennis-players' strengths is not surprising. The variance in-
crease per year was much smaller for the chess player data than for the tennis data, suggesting
more stability in chess playing strength than in tennis. This seems intuitively sensible
because the factors that result in a tennis-player performing well (e.g. physical condition,
responsiveness and lack of injuries) may be more variable over time than factors that result
in a chess player performing well (judgment, insight and ability to calculate variations).
Table 4 displays the posterior means and standard deviations of the strengths for the top
20 players ranked according to their posterior means. Players were included in the list if they
had played within four rating periods (8 months) of the end of 1995. The posterior means for
these top players have a greater spread than those for the top chess players, though because
the standard deviations are also larger it is more dicult to assert dierences in playing
strength. Agassi and Sampras have posterior means that are about 100 higher than those for
all other competitors. Posterior probabilities of game outcomes can be computed by using
formula (16). According to the parameter estimates, Sampras, ranked second, would defeat
Muster, ranked third, with a posterior probability of 0.63.

The last column of Table 4 shows the ocial ATP tour rankings of the players at the end of
1995, based on players accruing points depending on their successes in their best 14 tour-
naments over the previous 12 months. The players are then ranked according to the sum of
their points. Although this system does not use a probabilistic model to measure players'
strengths, it does produce a ranking list that conforms to generally held perceptions. The top
18 players in the ATP tour rankings appear in Table 4. The other two players are Stefan
Edberg, who is ranked 15 on our list, and Malivai Washington, who is ranked 20. Edberg
appears high on our list because he was inferred to be much stronger in the early 1990s, and
that the model ®t purports that he did not decline in ability as much as the ATP ranking
system indicates. Washington, interestingly, had the newsworthy result of competing in the
®nals at Wimbledon in 1996, so he may have been stronger, as our estimate shows, than
indicated by the ATP rank.

Discussion
The problem of developing a rating system for large paired comparison experiments with
time-varying abilities involves a trade-o between making full use of outcome information
and keeping a system that is suciently simple to be used regularly. The likelihood-based
state space approach provides inferences that are consistent with the model assumptions, but
the computational complexity can be enormous. The algorithm developed in this paper
attempts to combine desirable features of each approach to produce a system that is both
usable and accurate for time-dependent paired comparison situations.
Although it is computationally straightforward, the algorithm ignores certain features of
the model that a likelihood-based analysis would recognize. For example, information about
the results of opponents' games is sacri®ced to aid the computational ease of the algorithm.
More precision could be gained in a likelihood-based analysis because all players' results
would have an eect on inferences. A related issue is that posterior correlations of players'
strengths are not accounted for in our algorithm. If a player competes against one particular
opponent more frequently than against others, then a strong correlation may be induced.
Then both strength distributions should be aected when either player competes. However,
the bene®t in excluding correlations is that the number of model parameters is greatly
reduced. This is quite desirable when the number of players in the population is large. In any
event, the simulations in this paper seem to show that the approximating algorithm performs
reasonably well, and the application to the chess and tennis game data produced player
rankings that match external criteria.

Appendix A: Derivation of closed form computations
We derive a closed form normal approximation to the approximate posterior distribution of a player's
strength given in equation (8). The derivation of formulae (9) and (10) can be summarized in the
following three steps.
(a) Approximate the likelihood, marginalized over the opponents' prior strength distribution, by a
product of logistic cumulative distribution functions.

391

## Page 16

(b) Approximate the resulting expression by a normal distribution.
(c) Construct a linear approximation by using a Taylor series expansion around the prior mean to
determine the mean and variance of the approximating normal posterior distribution.
The likelihood, integrated over the distribution of the opponents' prior strength distribution, is given

Under the actual model, an opponent plays at a ®xed strength (which can be viewed as a single value of
j drawn from the prior distribution) for all games in a rating period. This last approximation is justi®ed
by allowing the possibility that an opponent can display dierent strengths for dierent games, the
strengths being drawn independently from the opponent's prior distribution.
An integral in the above product could be approximated easily by using numerical methods. Instead,
we approximate the integrals in expression (17), which are logistic cumulative distribution functions
(CDFs) integrated over normal densities, by rescaled logistic CDFs. This is accomplished by ®rst
approximating each logistic CDF in an integrand by a normal CDF with the same mean and variance so
that the integral can be evaluated in closed form to a normal CDF. The resulting normal CDF is then
converted back to a logistic CDF with the same mean and variance. This yields the approximation
